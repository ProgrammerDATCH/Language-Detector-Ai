This is language detector Ai that use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it was trained on Kinyarwanda, Kiswahili, French and English.

You give a sentence and it tells you which language it is written in.

# HOW IT WAS MADE

I used `sklearn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `re`, `string` to make a model, and just `streamlit` to make web-app and host it.

I trained model on 4,000 rows dataset of all 4 languages. I expect to extend Dataset to increase probability.
